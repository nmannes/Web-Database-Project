# Final Web Project B
As it stands now, our project lets users click around an extensive 
menu and query between one and two variables and see the results of that query

Feature List:
  - Query one variable
  - Query two variables
  - Generate graphs based on different types of categorical or continuous data
  - Extensive menu of variables to compare.
  - Graphs display plain-english variable meanings
  - Graphs are generated (or an appropriate error message is thrown) with all queries
  - Homepage explains how to use website

Our Data is called the General Social Survey (GSS) Cumulative Datafile 1972-2016
The site has no apparent licensing info. The data is freely available to download.

Our one feature that we would have liked to implement is supporting a third variable that would act as a control on the other two.
