# Final Web Project B
As it stands now, our project lets users click around an extensive 
menu. The user may query between one and two variables and see a graph of the results.

Feature List:
  - Query one variable
  - Query two variables
  - Generate graphs based on different types of categorical or continuous data
  - Extensive menu of variables to compare
  - Graphs display plain-english variable meanings
  - Graphs are generated (or an appropriate error message is thrown) with all queries
  - Homepage explains how to use website

Our Data is called the General Social Survey (GSS) Cumulative Datafile 1972-2016.
The site has no apparent licensing info. The data is freely available to download.

The next feature that we would have implemented was supporting a third control variable in each query.
